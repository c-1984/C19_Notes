15 April 2022
- Large population based study published in J Clin. Med. demonstrates that COVID-19 infection is not associated with increased incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis. This suggests that the rise in these conditions is coming from other factors...

1 March 2022
- First batch of documents released by FDA relating to BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine safety. Originally the FDA asked for 75 years to release these documents (see 8 December 2021) but thanks to lawsuit (see 6 January 2022) there will be 55,000 pages worth of documents released every month starting from today. There is a lot to go through but of interest there are some tables of adverse effects compared between the vaccine and placebo groups showing dose-dependence (i.e. more effects with second dose compared to first, although this document only details acute effects and not severe ones; https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/125742_S1_M5_c4591001-T-S-updated-reacto-tlf.pdf) as well as pharmacokinetic study info in mice, rats, primates and humans showing that an unexpectedly large proportion of lipid nanoparticle (20-60% depending on formulation of the LNP) localises to liver. This is not investigated further even though it is an apparently unexpected result  (https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/125742_S1_M2_26_pharmkin-written-summary.pdf and https://phmpt.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/125742_S1_M2_26_pharmkin-tabulated-summary.pdf) and that it has been known for months now that mRNA vaccination has been directly linked to liver inflammation/hepatitis in at least one documented medical case study (see 4 October 2021). All FDA documents here (sort by "Date Produced"): https://phmpt.org/pfizers-documents/

- Day 6 of Russian offensive in Ukraine. Parallels between the treatment of Russians and the unvaccinated of the COVID-19 crisis are worth noting as it's basically the concept of "two minutes hate" now redirected towards a new enemy.  Exclusion of Russians from various aspects of society across the world. No one is enforcing this, but cancelling Russia seems to have become the new thing to virtue signal.

- 4chan screenshot from September 2020 resurfaces following the news on 25 February 2022 that the Pfizer mRNA vaccine can be reverse transcribed into human DNA via LINE-1 retrotransposons. In the screenshot, a whistleblower from Moderna who claims to be an industrial engineer is suspicious of "small quantities of additions happening in manual step" which is apparently "highly unorthodox for a continuous process production", and later finds that small amounts of *CYP19A1* and *CDKN1B* are added which upregulate LINE-1 reverse transcription activity. Apparently this may result in "mildly oncogenic effects in vaccine recipients unlikely to be noticed for many years" and potentially "premature ovarian failure" in the next generation of female offspring. Should be taken with a grain of salt until more evidence surfaces, but considering that the post was from 2020 and is now consistent with what we are finding out about the LINE-1 retrotransposons (see 25 February 2022 and 6 May 2021), we should definitely be taking notice of this.  https://themariachiyears.substack.com/p/covid-vaccines-embryogenesis-and (Archive: https://archive.ph/86eUI)

25 February 2022
- Swedish research published in *Current Issues in Molecular Biology* shows that the Pfizer mRNA vaccine can be reverse transcribed into human DNA, in a human liver cell line. This happens through LINE-1 retrotransposons, and is consistent with previous findings from a paper published in *PNAS* from 6 May 2021 showing that RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be reverse transcribed through a LINE-1 retrotransposon mechanism as well. https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/3/73/htm

  - Zelensky released a video offering to negotiate directly with Russia. Russian reply noted that they would start negotiations after the Armed Forces of Ukraine lay down their arms, Ukraine must be demilitarized, declared neutral, and denazified. After that reply, Zelensky apparently stopped replying. 
  - Putin made a speech in which he suggested that Russia’s beef was only with the Nazis and their deathsquads but that Russia would seek to cooperate with the Ukrainian armed forces (well, what’s left of them, really) should they overthrow the Nazis. http://thesaker.is/putin-suggests-ukrainian-military-seize-power-from-gang-of-junkies-neo-nazis-in-kiev/

24 February 2022
- Day 1 of Russian offensive in Ukraine: Russia invades Ukraine and missile strikes are fired at "military installations" in Ukraine. The reason given is that Ukraine wants to join NATO and Russia does not want this to happen; however, there is evidence that tension has been building for many years now.

- 19-nucleotide sequence in the furin cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 virus perfectly matches sequence patented by Moderna from 2016. The sequence is not found in any other organism via BLAST search, providing further evidence of genetic tampering in the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Upon running the sequence through BlastX, this shows it matches well with a human protein involved in DNA repair. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fviro.2022.834808/full (Summary from Daily Sceptic: https://dailysceptic.org/2022/02/24/coronavirus-key-genetic-sequence-for-furin-cleavage-site-patented-by-moderna-in-2016/' Commentary by Chris Martenson here: https://odysee.com/@Chris_Martenson:2/nih-cover-up.-it-didn't-have-to-be-this:5; Commentary by Dr Been here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=zPoZTtruaB0&feature=youtu.be)

- *Science* magazine admits that, "in rare cases, coronavirus vaccines may cause Long Covid–like symptoms", and raises the possibility that the spike protein might be responsible: “We shouldn’t be averse to adverse events,” says William Murphy, an immunologist at the University of California, Davis. In November 2021 in The New England Journal of Medicine, he proposed that an autoimmune mechanism triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might explain both Long Covid symptoms and some rare vaccine side effects, and he called for more basic research to probe possible connections. https://www.science.org/content/article/rare-cases-coronavirus-vaccines-may-cause-long-covid-symptoms (Archive: https://archive.ph/D5x4K)

- Study published in *Cell* shows that vaccine spike protein and mRNA persist for 2 months in lymph node germinal centers. These findings are consistent with those from the study from 15 October 2021 indicating that spike protein circulates in blood plasma for ~4 months and provide an alternate perspective supporting that the contents of the mRNA vaccine persist in the body for longer than would be expected. https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(22)00076-9 Commentary from Dr Robert Malone: "One very real hypothesis is that the substitution of pseudouridine for uridine to avoid the immune response is working so well that the mRNA is completely evading the normal clearance/degradation pathways. Hence, mRNA that is not being incorporated into cells at the injection site, is migrating to the lymph nodes (and throughout the body as the non-clinical Pfizer data suggest?) and continuing to express protein there." https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/a-health-public-policy-nightmare (Archive: https://archive.ph/VVAeh)

- Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus (Pango Network lineage B.1.1.529, Nextstrain clade 21K) is rapidly spreading in South Africa. Interestingly, the genetic sequence of Omicron does not resemble currently circulating variants like Delta or even Alpha. It appears that Omicron's closest evolutionary connection is to mid-2020 viruses. In addition, there are a high number of mutations in the spike protein S1 domain, which means it is likely to evade vaccine-mediated immunity. https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1464353245380243457 https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/africa?fbclid=IwAR0nQ3gmpps_V9hED3X7dxaAPhuCfEmRlCoaJsl1_2eh3fjtii6ejP8Sw6Y&l=scatter&scatterY=S1_mutations (Archive: https://archive.ph/LIZIr)

- Study published in *Viruses* finds that the vaccine appears to interfere with the natural immunity that normally develops after COVID-19 infection. The study happened over 291 days; however, over half of those who had been vaccinated after developing natural immunity had no detectable N antibody after only 180 days. "From day 14 to day 291, more than 75% of the samples were positive for NAbs (n = 87/110, 79.1%). Interestingly, 6 months post symptoms onset, the majority of the samples (N = 44/52, 84.6%) were still positive for NAbs. **This is in sharp contrast with the results we obtained 6 months post-vaccination in our cohort of healthcare workers who have received the two-dose regimens of BNT162b2. In this cohort of vaccinated subjects, 43% (n = 25/58) of the participants no longer exhibit NAbs activity 180 days after the administration of the first dose of BNT162b2.**" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8621742/ This finding is consistent with earlier reporting from Alex Berenson from 22 October 2021, who noticed a similar observation from a UK government report.

- Pre-print research indicates that a booster shot of Pfizer or Moderna results in a greater number of adverse events. The authors did not come to this conclusion in the text, but their figures in the Supplementary Information (apparently not important enough for the main text!) indicate a dose-dependent relationship (see Figures S2 and S3). Interestingly, the figures are also not broken down by age group or sex. This speaks volumes, especially knowing that some effects are both sex and age-dependent (e.g. myocarditis, menstrual issues). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.05.21265961v1.full-text

- Group of Swedish medical professionals call for the suspension of the Pfizer vaccine. "...The strong suspicion that parts of the clinical trial of Pfizer's vaccine were not performed in a scientifically acceptable manner and where the study result cannot be considered reliable, in combination with the large volume of reported suspected side effects after vaccination, many of a serious nature, make us, as doctors, researchers and immunologists, deeply concerned. Not the least for the children who run an extremely low risk of serious illness with covid-19, but who are at risk serious side effects. That the vaccine' efficacy has waned sharply already after a few months and is weak against the delta variant of the virus contributes to our conclusion that covid vaccination in Sweden should be paused until risk / benefit calculations are made for all age groups. Our position is taken in the light of the revelation in BMJ and what we know today about the risks to the patient." https://lakaruppropet.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pressmeddelande-5-nov-2021.pdf (Archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XesXi2UeQ5pMdeZvV3w0KYFSsv-1QgbV/view?usp=sharing)

OSR director Ed Humpherson: "It remains the case that the surveillance report includes rates per 100,000 which can be used to argue that vaccines are not effective. [...] In publishing these data, you need to address more comprehensively the risk that it misleads people into thinking that it says something about vaccine effectiveness. One possibility would be to only publish rates in the vaccinated population, which are known accurately, but I recognise your concern that you are already publishing rates for both groups.

- Pre-print study from Sweden indicates that vaccine efficacy wanes significantly after 90 days, and becomes negative after 240 days. The interpretation of this "negative efficacy" is interesting as it implies that after this amount of time has passed, vaccinated individuals are more likely to have a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Other studies have shown that waning immunity occurs at the 3-month mark, which is consistent with the findings here. Will be interesting to see whether the "negative efficacy" finding is consistent with other published studies as more data comes out. https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/swedish-study-shows-covid-vaccines (Archive: https://archive.ph/Glh0c)

- List of 40 studies from the past 2 years that raise doubts on vaccine mandates is made available. https://brownstone.org/articles/16-studies-on-vaccine-efficacy/ (Archive: https://archive.ph/cGY9X) The "fact check" for this particular article says that the information is false as some of the studies are pre-prints and that the information conflicts with information on the CDC website (literally cannot make this shit up 😂). https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-19-studies-on-vaccine-efficacy-do-not-raise-doubts-on-vaccine-mandates.html

27 October 2021
- A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 that evades vaccine-induced immunity is discovered. Published in Nature, this paper describes the variant “A.30” that evades vaccine-mediated immunity from both the mRNA (e.g. Pfizer, Moderna) and adenovirus (e.g. AstraZeneca, J&J) vaccine technologies currently on the market. The authors of the paper note that the spike protein of this variant is heavily mutated, with 10 amino acid substitutions and five deletions. (This is consistent with selective pressure on the spike protein due to mass vaccination as suggested by Geert Vanden Bossche months ago). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00779-5

- Thousands of people march in New York to protest vaccine mandates. Like the recent protests in Italy (see 19 October 2021), this one also goes unreported by mainstream media: https://mobile.twitter.com/i/status/1452684767972007945 Archive: https://archive.ph/MOWpJ 

- In the US, “ERs are now swamped with seriously ill patients — but many don't even have COVID.” Some of the symptoms being displayed seem suspiciously close to the blood clots and heart condtions known to be adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines: “Doctors and nurses say the severity of illness ranges widely and includes abdominal pain, respiratory problems, blood clots, heart conditions and suicide attempts, among others.” https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/10/26/1046432435/ers-are-now-swamped-with-seriously-ill-patients-but-most-dont-even-have-covid Archive: https://archive.ph/MTTha Commentary by el gato: https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/why-are-so-many-in-the-us-now-so 

- Billionaires George Soros and Reid Hoffman are putting millions of dollars towards combating misinformation, through a “public benefit corporation” called “Good Information Inc.”. This corporation will apparently be “committed to restoring social trust and strengthening democracy by increasing the flow of accurate information”. It seems the misinformation that these billionaires are concerned with relates in particular to “false claims spread around the coronavirus pandemic”. (This is not satire.) https://thehill.com/homenews/media/578499-soros-backing-new-media-effort-to-battle-disinformation Archive: https://archive.ph/hz2SH 

- Research published in *Cell Discovery* finds that blood markers after COVID-19 vaccination are altered for up to 90 days following vaccination with an inactivated virus vaccine. Markers that were altered include hemoglobin A1c, serum sodium and potassium levels, coagulation profiles (e.g. APTT, PT), cholesterol, and renal functions. The findings of increased blood coagulation support a previous study predicting increased blood viscosity post-vaccination (see 18 June 2021). https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-021-00329-3 (Archive: https://archive.ph/YXEjN)

- #Beaglegate hashtag is trending on Twitter. Beaglegate is reported across mainstream news, describing a series of inhumane NIH-funded experiments involving beagles. https://nypost.com/2021/10/24/lawmakers-slam-anthony-fauci-for-alleged-puppy-experiments/ https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/fauci-puppy-experiments-conspiracy-republicans/ These experiments were uncovered by White Coat Waste Project several months ago  (https://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2021/07/30/fauci-funding-wasteful-deadly-dog-tests/ and https://blog.whitecoatwaste.org/2021/08/31/photos-fauci-funded-beagle-torture-overseas-too/), but are conveniently coming into the spotlight just as the true extent of Fauci’s involvement in funding gain-of-function coronavirus research in Wuhan has just been coming to light (see 22 October 2021, 20 October 2021). The idea that Beaglegate could be a pretext to get rid of Fauci is brought up: https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/is-beaglegate-just-a-pretext-to-get 

- Beloved Australian cartoonist Leunig is axed after he shares a cartoon that draws a parallel between China’s Tiananmen Square and the current increasing totalitarianism seen in Australia’s vaccine mandates:  https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10126303/Cartoonist-Leunig-AXED-cartoon-comparing-Dan-Andrews-vaccine-mandates-Tiananmen-Square.html Archive: https://archive.ph/89l6y As Jordan Peterson has noted (for a different comedian, but relevant here too), “Courage and comedy are not different. An old friend said to me once ‘you can say anything you want as long as it's true or funny.’ Never forgot that. Anyone who attacks a comedian is a tyrant-in-waiting.” We have now gone far beyond the removal or “fact checking” of “misinformation” online (see 22 February 2020, 27 January 2020). How long until “wrongthink” is considered a crime?

- Normalisation of “quarantine facilities” in Australia continues. Annastacia Palaszczuk, Queensland Premier, stated on television that, "I think regional quarantine facilities are going to be needed in the future. We can't predict what is going to happen but there may be a country that's declared a red spot or a no go zone area, and we may need to bring back people from those different countries. And they all need to be chartered in, it's no different than what we have seen during this pandemic. We'll also need it for unvaccinated people, we'll also need it for people who are international students who are looking at doing labor for our farmers, so I think there's a whole lot of opportunities as well." https://twitter.com/sunriseon7/status/1450218694555041797 (On 14 August 2021, the construction of the quarantine facility, named “The Centre for National Resilience”, began in Melbourne.) 

- A UK government report hints that those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 and subsequently infected with the virus, do not build full immunity. It seems that being vaccinated means they do not build as much N protein antibody compared to those who recovered while unvaccinated. This phenomenon is called “original antigenic sin” and is well-documented in some other viruses. https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/original-antigenic-sin Archive: https://archive.ph/sXH48 https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/urgent-covid-vaccines-will-keep-you/ Archive: https://archive.ph/435iG https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1027511/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-42.pdf Archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WVc5ILfH1IO21y2_GBoG5iOlulYJd7zJ/view?usp=drivesdk 

- The goalposts continue to move, as reported by The Washington Post: “You’re not ‘fully vaccinated.’ You never will be. It’s a goal for communities or nations, not for individuals.” https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/fully-vaccinated-coronavirus/2021/10/21/d0f9a2d4-321b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html Archive: https://archive.ph/7IZ6e This message directly contradicts CDC information from 16 August 2021 this year (https://archive.ph/lvjHl), where it is stated that it is possible for individuals to be fully-vaccinated for COVID-19, and this allows them to “build protection” and immunity to the virus. 

- More companies that have nothing to do with health keen to implement vaccine mandates for some reason: Coca-Cola mandates vaccination for its 8,500 US employees, offering a $2,000 bonus for complying with the mandate. https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qgberu/cocacola_mandates_vaccine_to_all_8500_usbased/  Archive: https://archive.ph/mveJ3

21 October 2021
- Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), consisting of a group of highly qualified doctors and academics, engaged with a formal exchange with the CDC on whether natural immunity is better than COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity. In response to the lacklustre and evasive response by the CDC,  ICAN has issued a formal warning to the CDC that they are intending on initiating a lawsuit. https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Reply-to-CDC-Re-Natural-Immunity-v-Vaccine-Immunity.pdf Archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6l9JnJuwjulz5XC-6_xYPTLE6SYc3Cm/view?usp=sharing 

- As of today, the CDC website page on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness has still not been updated since 16 August 2021, Their page, considered by the MSM to be highly trustworthy, is embarrassingly outdated. For example, despite the overwhelming evidence including 70+ studies as of 15 October 2021  (https://trialsitenews.com/is-there-evidence-that-natural-exposure-immunity-to-covid-virus-is-similar-or-superior-to-vaccine-induced-immunity-and-should-we-force-mandate-these-vaccines-on-our-healthy-military-and-police) indicating that natural immunity is better than or as good as vaccine-mediated immunity, the CDC cherry picks the only study (with a small sample size and numerous flaws), to say that: "Evidence is emerging that people get better protection by being fully vaccinated compared with having had COVID-19. One study showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than 2 times as likely than fully vaccinated people to get COVID-19 again." In addition, CDC claims that, “We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated”, despite clear antibody-level evidence that vaccine-mediated immunity wanes significantly after 6 months, and that highly-vaccinated countries do not see a decrease in cases (see 30 September 2021). https://archive.ph/meCGE https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html 

- Vaccine mandate is announced for all healthcare workers in South Australia, following similar mandates in Victoria and New South Wales. This is despite the fact that there are only 2 active cases in SA currently, as compared to >4,000 in NSW and >1,500 in Victoria. All healthcare workers need to be vaccinated by 8 November, otherwise will be unable to work. Regular testing is apparently not accepted as an alternative to vaccination, and even pregnant women are unable to get medical exemptions anymore.

- Australian biotech company Vaxine sets up crowdfunding to raise funds for the approval of their locally-developed recombinant protein vaccine, Covax-19, after failing to get any support from the Australian government. Covax-19 has shown strong protection against the Delta variant in a Phase 3 clinical trial in the Middle East.

19 October 2021
- Massive, unreported protests in Trieste, Italy, have been occurring this whole week, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to protest mandatory vaccination and the Green Pass. Surprisingly, while public footage is abundant on Twitter, this is not being reported across any mainstream media. There is evidence that “live webcams” are being manipulated by replacing current footage with past footage to make it appear that the areas full of people are empty.  https://boriquagato.substack.com/p/protest-in-trieste-we-the-people Archive: https://archive.ph/IzQ6s https://twitter.com/BernieSpofforth/status/1450208428740255744?s=20 

- Australian Professor, Dr Thomas Borody, reports successful and safe treatment of 600 Covid-19 patients from Sydney and Melbourne with the ivermectin triple therapy protocol he has developed (ivermectin used with doxycycline and zinc). Unfortunately, the study was terminated when the Australian government banned GPs from prescribing ivermectin on 10 September 2021. https://trialsitenews.com/combination-therapy-for-covid-19-based-on-ivermectin-in-an-australian-population/ PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oqkz0qnGJYX-Mel-XFchAcW2sc1C_6pq/view?usp=sharing 

- Realisation that including the Individual Health Identifier on Australian vaccination certificates is a “bad mistake”. It turns out that, “You face up to two years imprisonment for use or disclosure of the IHI for any purposes outside of supporting healthcare.

- Vaccine injury claims in the US are increasing, but legal recourse is lacking. The government requires the burden of proof is on individuals to prove their injuries are “the direct result” of a COVID-19 vaccine. Reuters highlights that: “It’s a steep burden of proof. Lawyers tell me the vaccine is so new that there’s virtually no definitive research on injury causation to cite.” Worryingly, “the overwhelming majority of all litigants under what's known as the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program have not succeeded. According to program data, 29 claims have been paid for injuries stemming from other vaccines since the tribunal’s inception in 2010. (Ten additional claims won approval but no compensation.) The other 455 claims – 92% – were denied or otherwise deemed ineligible for review. For those who prevailed, the median award was $5,677, according to my calculations, spanning from a low of $31 to a high of $2.3 million, for a person who contracted Guillain-Barre Syndrome after receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine.” https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/covid-vaccine-injury-claims-mount-recourse-is-lacking-those-harmed-2021-10-19/ Archive: https://archive.ph/ImF5N

USAToday: “Although dying from COVID-19 is extremely uncommon among the fully vaccinated, health experts say age and preexisting medical conditions may increase the odds of breakthrough infection, severe disease and even death.” (Interesting that older people / those with preexisting medical conditions were originally the ones who were recommended to take the vaccine in the first place to protect themselves…) https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/10/18/vaccine-covid-19-colin-powell-high-risk/8505663002/ Archive: https://archive.ph/H9U4K 

- French biotech company Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001, reports promising results from their Phase III trials. VLA2001 is a whole virus, inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine candidate that uses analogous technology to traditional vaccines, except that the density of spike protein on the virus has been increased. Apparently, there are less adverse events than AstraZeneca, and efficacy also appears good, with participants building immunity to S, N, and M proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. (It is interesting that despite not taking only a few months longer to create, all other pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Moderna, chose to use a novel mRNA technology instead of proven traditional technologies.) https://trialsitenews.com/valneva-reports-its-covid-19-vaccine-vla200-candidate-is-superior-to-astrazenecas-in-phase-3-cov-compare-trial/ PDF: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eOoK5B1X7sOtn02EpgUbHiOKBQV1RSYF/view?usp=sharing

15 October 2021
- Bombshell manuscript published in The Journal of Immunology, showing that spike proteins are expressed on the surface of exosomes after mRNA vaccination, and the exosomes continue to circulate in the blood for 4 MONTHS. This provides a clear mechanism whereby the effects of spike protein reach different organs (especially as they are expressed on the surface of exosomes). (This evidence is also consistent with the Pfizer biodistribution data made available by FOIA in Japan showing that lipid nanoparticles accumulated in organs including ovaries.) https://www.jimmunol.org/content/early/2021/10/11/jimmunol.2100637 https://twitter.com/kevin_mckernan/status/1450514230625517569?s=21 

- By this point, there is overwhelming evidence that natural immunity to COVID-19 is likely better than or at least as good as vaccine-mediated immunity. In an article authored by a team of three researchers including Dr Peter McCullough, the findings of 70+ research articles supporting natural immunity are summarised. https://trialsitenews.com/is-there-evidence-that-natural-exposure-immunity-to-covid-virus-is-similar-or-superior-to-vaccine-induced-immunity-and-should-we-force-mandate-these-vaccines-on-our-healthy-military-and-police/ Archive: https://archive.ph/z6Gpx

13 October 2021
- *In vitro* study in cell line shows that the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein localises to the nucleus of cells, where it impairs DNA damage repair. "Our findings reveal a potential molecular mechanism by which the spike protein might impede adaptive immunity and underscore the potential side effects of full-length spike-based vaccines." This is concerning considering that most of the current COVID-19 vaccines use full-length spike protein as their antigen. https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/13/10/2056/htm (DOI: 10.3390/v13102056).

Pre-print research released detailing results from a survey of >39,000 women, with over half of them experiencing menstrual irregularities after COVID-19 vaccination. Notably, some groups of women who are not supposed to menstruate (those on the pill/contraceptives, women taking testosterone to transition into trans-men, women who are post-menopausal) are experiencing “breakthrough” periods at a startlingly high rate. No explanation as yet for why this is happening. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.11.21264863v1

- Israeli Ministry of Health finds that booster shots in Israel are not preventing infections, so they have resorted to retroactively falsifying the data to show the conclusions they want. Fortunately, some people took screenshots documenting the changes: “For example (as can be seen it in the screenshots below, released by the council), if originally on a given day there were 118 vaccinated confirmed cases vs 242 unvaccinated - it suddenly became 10 vaccinated vs. 350 unvaccinated," Koren explains. "That is, blatant changes, which our examination shows were made over months. They did not just 'round' corners - but actually drastically re-wrote the whole history.”

- Biden’s speech remarks are sounding increasingly authoritarian, blaming the unvaccinated using blatantly divisive language: “The fact is, this has been a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Unvaccinated. The unvaccinated overcrowd our hospitals, overrunning emergency rooms and intensive care units. The unvaccinated patients are — are leaving no room for someone with a heart attack or in need of a cancer operation and so much more because they can’t get into the ICU”. He even blames the unvaccinated for the worsening economy: “The unvaccinated also put our economy at risk because people are reluctant to go out.” He appears proud that people have gotten fired over their refusal to be vaccinated: “Let’s be clear: When you see headlines and reports of “mass firings” and “hundreds” of people losing their jobs, look at the bigger story.” https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/10/07/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-importance-of-covid-19-vaccine-requirements/ https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/q4b4bv/im_getting_super_worried_about_joe_bidens/

- Sweden suspends use of Moderna vaccine for those under 30, Denmark said those under 18 won’t be offered the Moderna vaccine, and Norway urged those under 30 to get the Pfizer vaccine instead of Moderna. “All three countries based their decision on an unpublished study with Sweden’s Public Health Agency saying that it signals “an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle or the pericardium” with those under 30 at particularly higher risk. https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-denmark-public-health-health-453163d8f93618fde90c06d3474921a0 (This is interesting considering that a single dose of the Moderna vaccine contains 100ug of spike protein mRNA while a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine contains only 30ug of spike protein mRNA, suggesting spike protein mRNA may have dose-dependent toxicity. https://kamal-mokeddem.medium.com/spike-protein-a-dose-dependent-killer-2e26ec28de3f) Also see 29 September 2021 for a similar decision by Ontario, Canada.

- The evidence for the lab leak theory is becoming so difficult to ignore that even mainstream news is reporting that it is likely feasible. WSJ: “Four studies—including two from WHO—provide powerful evidence favoring the lab-leak theory.” https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-coronavirus-lab-leak-virology-origins-pandemic-11633462827?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/A4qRquHJjt

4 October 2021
- Waning immunity of the Pfizer vaccine has now made it into mainstream media. (I guess the difference between a conspiracy theory and fact is only 6 months 🙃) CNBC: “The effectiveness of Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine against infection tumbles over several months, falling from a peak of 88% a month after receiving the two-shot series to 47% six months later.” https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/pfizer-covid-vaccine-protection-against-infection-tumbles-to-47percent-study-confirms.html

- Multiple strands of evidence of adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines have now become evident. From dose-dependent increases in cytokines/chemokines, to the high correlation between mRNA dose and fatality rate (particularly relevant as mRNA dose is higher in Moderna than Pfizer), some of the recent evidence is summarised here: https://roundingtheearth.substack.com/p/mechanistic-evidence-of-vaccine-induced

- Case report published in *Journal of Hepatology* linking a case of hepatitis (liver inflammation) directly to the Moderna mRNA vaccine. https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(21)02093-6/fulltext Interestingly, this is consistent with previous research in a mouse model showing that mRNA COVID-19 vaccination led to "ballooning hepatocytes" in the livers of the mice (see 18 August 2021). 

3 October 2021
- Israel pushing ahead with its redefinition of “fully vaccinated” to mean 3 doses. Previously fully-vaccinated (2 dose) Israelis will now lose their vaccine passports as they have not received the third dose: “As of Thursday, some 1.6 million Israelis who are entitled to receive the third dose of the coronavirus vaccine still have not done so, meaning they will be ineligible for the new green passport.” https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/covid-vaccination-pass-israel-about-to-expire-here-s-how-to-get-a-new-one-1.10255927

- Vaccine effectiveness is dropping in the UK according to a Public Health England report recently released. A commentary on the results by The Daily Sceptic reports that: “For the 60s age group, infection rates are 63% higher in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated, up from 53% last week, giving an (unadjusted) vaccine effectiveness of minus-63%.” https://dailysceptic.org/2021/10/03/vaccine-effectiveness-hits-as-low-as-minus-66-in-the-over-40s-new-phe-data-shows

- NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian resigns as NSW Premier as the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) announces an investigation. The investigation is not related to COVID-19, but it is interesting to note that information about how her pandemic policies have been apparently influenced by lobbyists who have been paid millions by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to drive vaccine policy is also coming to light.

- Paper by Jessica Rose, PhD and Dr Peter McCullough on myocarditis adverse events in the US VAERS database was withdrawn after being accepted for publication in *Current Problems in Cardiology*. The paper's findings indicate that myocarditis adverse events are abnormally high after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The authors were not notified that their paper was withdrawn.  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0146280621002267?via%3Dihub

30 September 2021
- Health experts have been left baffled by a big rise in a common and potentially fatal type of heart attack in the west of Scotland. “During the summer there was a 25 per cent rise in the number of people rushed to the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Clydebank with partially blocked arteries cutting blood supply to the heart.” https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mystery-rise-in-heart-attacks-from-blocked-arteries-m253drrnf 

- Evidence is clear at this stage that being vaccinated does not necessarily confer long-lasting protection against COVID-19, particularly the Delta variant that is currently dominant. A few key pieces of evidence: 1) A pre-print is posted on bioRxiv demonstrating that Pfizer vaccine-mediated immunity (both in terms of antibody responses and T cell immunity) wanes significantly after 6 months, to the extent that approx. half of the vaccinated individuals in their sample tested have neutralizing titers below the detection limit. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.462488v1 2) Peer-reviewed study on healthcare workers published in NEJM indicates that the percentage of COVID-19 cases amongst healthcare workers has been increasing from May to July in their Table 1. As of July, 75.2% of COVID-19 cases are in the vaccinated. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112981 3) A peer-reviewed analysis is published that indicates that countries with high levels of vaccination also tend to have higher numbers of COVID-19 cases (the EXACT opposite of what we expect vaccination would result in, see their Figure 1).

- The number of deaths from all causes registered in Scotland in this week was 1,257. This is 249 or 25%, more than the five year average. Those 1,257 deaths include 135 deaths that mentioned COVID-19 - the highest weekly total since March (because vaccines work!). But even excluding those, non-Covid deaths are running more than 10% above normal. Interesting considering that 91 percent of people 16 and over in Scotland have received at least one dose and 84 percent have received two doses. https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/news/2021/deaths-involving-covid-19-week-37-13-to-19-september-2021 https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/fair-is-foul-and-foul-is-fair

- Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state of 230 million people, is almost COVID-19 free despite low vaccination rates. This is due to the availability of early treatment including ivermectin. The use of ivermectin was information that was omitted in most reporting, including in the WHO’s own coverage of the situation. For the first time, a mainstream news source (Microsoft News / MSN) has finally reported on the use of ivermectin here.

- Prof. Peter Doherty, immunologist and Nobel laureate, is confused over what natural immunity is: "They rely on what they call 'natural immunity', a term that's new to me.

- The number of COVID-19 cases has increased over the past few months but this is misleading, because the definition of a “case” has changed. The % of cases that are asymptomatic has been gradually increasing over the past few months. “From March 2020 through early January 2021 — before vaccination was widespread, and before the Delta variant had arrived — the proportion of patients with mild or asymptomatic disease was 36 percent. From mid-January through the end of June 2021, however, that number rose to 48 percent.” https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/covid-hospitalization-numbers-can-be-misleading/620062/?utm_medium=offsite&utm_source=medium&utm_campaign=all

- Data from Israel surfaces, showing that 1,400 active COVID-19 cases in partially-vaccinated 12-15 year-olds suddenly disappear after the definition of being "fully vaccinated" is changed. The new definition of "fully vaccinated" now requires 3 doses in Israel, with 2 doses considered "partially vaccinated". However, the 1,400 COVID-19 cases in those previously considered to be "partially vaccinated" (1 dose, before the definition changed) have disappeared and they have not been "moved" to the "unvaccinated" group either. This raises questions regarding the lack of data transparency and whether the data are being potentially manipulated to make it appear that COVID-19 cases in 12-15 year olds are not increasing after vaccination. https://twitter.com/connolly_s/status/1437366313689796611/photo/1  Archive: https://archive.md/JN78y

After she is banned, she goes live on Instagram and reveals that many in Hollywood feel the same way about the vaccines and are scared to speak out. https://www.instagram.com/tv/CT3hjWVp9wa/?utm_medium=copy_link   Interestingly while the media was quick to cancel her and “fact check” her, testicular effects have been reported to VAERS, so what she is saying is not unreasonable. https://trialsitenews.com/nicki-minaj-was-right-and-all-the-worlds-covid-vaccine-experts-were-wrong/ 

- Israeli Ministry of Health caught on camera saying that "there is no medical or epidemiological justification for the Covid passport, it is only intended to pressure the unvaccinated to vaccinate". https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1437396043424059396?s=21 

- The Lancet publishes a commentary saying that “the currently available evidence does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccination in populations that have received an effective primary vaccination regimen”. The lead author on the paper is Dr Phil Krause, one of the FDA vaccine experts who resigned from the FDA on 31 August 2021 citing concerns with the booster shot approval.

- /r/NoNewNormal subreddit banned for "community interference". /r/NoNewNormal was a discussion forum focused on all things beyond the mainstream narrative surrounding COVID-19. It was previously "quarantined" on Reddit (unsearchable via search bar) due to "misinformation". There are some subreddits out there with very questionable and arguably unethical content which I won't mention here, yet they are still allowed to persist under free speech, so it is unbelievable that this community was banned. The new forum has moved to https://communities.win/c/NoNewNormal/ 

- The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter reporting waning  SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection in 19,000 healthcare workers in San Diego, which decreased from 94%+ in March through June to 65% in July. Also reported that vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were about as likely to be symptomatic (which is consistent with previous studies showing they had similar viral loads and transmission). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2112981

- Two of the FDA's most senior vaccine leaders are retiring from their positions. The apparent reason? "A former senior FDA leader told Endpoints that they’re departing because they’re frustrated that CDC and their ACIP committee are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the FDA (...) What finally did it for them was the White House getting ahead of FDA on booster shots." https://endpts.com/breaking-in-a-major-blow-to-vaccine-efforts-senior-fda-leaders-stepping-down-report/ https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/top-fda-officials-quit-following-disagreement-with-bidens-rushed-covid-booster-shot-plan/

- Alex Berenson brings attention to an interesting trend whereby countries that have a large number of their population receive the first dose of a SARS-CoV2 vaccination, are associated with a large number of COVID-19 cases soon thereafter. Vietnam is used as a case study here, and this trend is similar to that seen in Israel and Britain in January. https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/insanity-in-vietnam

- 1000+ church leaders in Australia take a stance against vaccine passports by signing an letter to the Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which “presents five objections to the introduction of vaccine passports in Australia. That is, (1) The risk of creating an unethical two-tiered society; (2) The added burden on an already burdened society; (3) Government should never coerce conscience; (4) Arbitrary implementation and questionable science; (5) The inability of churches to exclude people from worship based on their medical status.” https://caldronpool.com/over-400-church-leaders-take-a-stand-against-vaccine-passports-in-open-letter-to-prime-minister-scott-morrison/?fbclid=IwAR1OJ2MklbB1M9XUoM0x43XG_o0A5VnwzCGJ2uMLXBsW1pmyDhJFaJLFHTY

- FDA report released regarding Pfizer vaccine, COMINARTY, approval. It looks like FDA sees that there is insufficient data to assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis. They also acknowledge “the pharmacovigilance system [VAERS] that FDA is required to maintain under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA is not sufficient to assess these serious risks.” FDA report refers to planned timelines submitted by Pfizer on 21 August, for long term studies of myocarditis (ending in 2027) and pregnancy outcomes (ending in 2025).

- Preprint research on the evolution of Delta SARS-CoV2 towards ADE. When four mutations were introduced into the RBD, this caused the virus to have immune escape to the current vaccines. At the moment, some strains already have 3 mutations in the RBD, so evolutionary escape seems inevitable at this rate.

We should trust science. And when scientists speak science, we should trust them, because we should recognize that they are speaking in a way that is based on evidence. When scientists express political views or policy preferences or even claims about how the world is that are not citing evidence, we should not give those scientists undue deference…They are people.

- Revealed that the UK government is using covert “psychological strategies” to manipulate public behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dated March 22, the paper written by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) stated: “A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened; it could be that they are reassured by the low death rate in their demographic group, although levels of concern may be rising … the perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging. To be effective this must also empower people by making clear the actions they can take to reduce the threat.” The same document presented a grid of 14 options for increasing compliance which included “use media to increase sense of personal threat”, a tactic which was seen as having a “high” effectiveness though spill-over effects “could be negative”. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/state-fear-ministers-used-covert-tactics-keep-scared-public/ Archive 1: https://web.archive.org/web/20210402190754/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/02/state-fear-ministers-used-covert-tactics-keep-scared-public/ Archive 2: https://archive.ph/MtGT6

- Environmental Chemistry Letters: “More than a year after the initial documented cases in Wuhan, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, and the search for a direct or intermediate host in nature has been so far unsuccessful. While a natural origin is still possible and the search for a potential host in nature should continue, the amount of peculiar genetic features identified in SARS-CoV-2′s genome does not rule out a possible gain-of-function origin, which should be therefore discussed in an open scientific debate.” https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0

- Surgisphere scandal comes to light. Surgisphere is an American Healthcare Analytics company that came under scrutiny in May 2020 after it had provided large datasets of COVID-19 patients which were subsequently found to be extremely unreliable. The questionable data was used in studies published in the The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2020, suggesting that COVID-19 patients on hydroxychloroquine had a "significantly higher risk of death." In light of these studies, the World Health Organization decided to temporarily halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. “It sounds absurd that an obscure US company with a hastily constructed website could have driven international health policy and brought major clinical trials to a halt within the span of a few weeks. Yet that’s what happened earlier this year, when Illinois-based Surgisphere Corporation began a publishing spree that would trigger one of the largest scientific scandals of the COVID-19 pandemic to date." https://www.the-scientist.com/features/the-surgisphere-scandal-what-went-wrong--67955 https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/whos-blame-these-three-scientists-are-heart-surgisphere-covid-19-scandal

The report also mentions the possibility that more people will die because of the state-imposed lockdown measures than are being killed by the virus. “Therapeutic and preventive measures should never bring more harm than the illness itself.

It clearly states that the citizen has the responsibility not to spread a disease. This is the core we started from, because there is not much legal possibility to close down cities in Sweden using the present laws. Quarantine can be contemplated for people or small areas, such as a school or a hotel. But [legally] we cannot lock down a geographical area.” https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01098-x

- Dr Lawrence Broxmeyer, MD, brings attention to evidence that azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine appear to significantly quicken time to recovery in COVID-19 patients. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that also happens to be the first line of defence against fowl tuberculosis (also known as Mycobacterium avium). This is the first time in history that an antibiotic is showing effectiveness against an apparent viral disease and provides additional evidence that in China at least, some of the severe COVID-19 cases may be due to coinfection with tuberculosis or activation of latent tuberculosis. https://coronacircus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Promising_Antimicrobial_Hope_for_Coronav.pdf Further consistent with this, it is later found in countries like the US which do not have active tuberculosis outbreaks, that azithromycin is not that effective. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00263-0/fulltext

- Pre-print research released that finds an intriguing correlation between COVID-19 severity in countries and whether they have universal policies of BCG vaccination, which is used to immunise people against tuberculosis: “We found that countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies. Countries that have a late start of universal BCG policy (Iran, 1984) had high mortality, consistent with the idea that BCG protects the vaccinated elderly population. We also found that BCG vaccination also reduced the number of reported COVID-19 cases in a country.” https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042937v1 See also 16 March 2020 for more evidence that tuberculosis is a risk factor for severe COVID-19.

As long as they were medically stable, the notice said, it was appropriate to move patients in. Further, nursing homes were prohibited from requiring that medically stable prospective residents be tested for the virus before they arrived.

- Dr. Anthony Fauci admits that PCR testing cycle threshold over 35 will detect “dead nucleotides”, not actively replicating virus: “What is now evolving ... if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more that the chances of it being replication competent are miniscule... It's very frustrating for the patients as well as for the physicians. Somebody comes in and they repeat their PCR and it's like 37 cycle threshold, but you can almost never culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle. So I think if somebody does come in with 37, 38 -- even 36. You gotta say, 'You know, it's just dead nucleotides -- period.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhMvLUtds3I Unfortunately, cycle thresholds of 45 were being recommended by WHO (see 17 January 2020) and were being (and still are) used by many countries for their COVID-19 testing.

22 February 2020
- Social media begins censorship of COVID-19 “misinformation”. Only a month ago (see 27 January 2020), they started placing “Fact Checks”. Now, they have resorted to removing information they deem to be false, including a New York Post article by a Chinese scholar presenting evidence that “coronavirus may have leaked from a lab”. The article is immediately removed when people try to post it to Facebook: https://nypost.com/2020/02/22/dont-buy-chinas-story-the-coronavirus-may-have-leaked-from-a-lab/

- In the Italian city of Padua, authorities make the decision to burn and destroy nearly 10 tons of pig meat originating from China. The meat was suspected to be infected with African swine fever and potentially fowl tuberculosis, the latter of which is likely transmissible to humans. Notably, one of the first cases of COVID-19 in Italy is found in Padua. Interestingly, fowl tuberculosis symptoms include fever, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, cough, which are also reported in COVID-19 patients. (Later, see 16 March 2020, it is also found that tuberculosis infection is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 in Wuhan. Could this be an explanation for why Italy was hit so hard by COVID-19, when those in many other countries including neighbouring countries were experiencing only mild illness?) https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pfigshare-u-files/22204929/FINALSCIENTIAITALYINCRISISSRPRRC03000272.pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Expires=10&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=b9d1d53eefc8ca9889afe64067f4d8fdf681e9dcc604c3835a615df4254baac6&X-Amz-Date=20211019T101110Z&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIYCQYOYV5JSSROOA/20211019/eu-west-1/s3/aws4_request https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Italy_in_Crisis/12077577

- EVENT 201: Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with WEF & the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsor a high-level pandemic exercise called “Event 201”, involving a fictional SARS pandemic meant to illustrate areas where public/private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic. It is interesting to note that one of the members in attendance is George F. Gao, Director-General of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control. In October 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely spreading among humans in Wuhan, very likely with Gao’s knowledge. He stays quiet throughout the exercise.

- Satellite images in Wuhan show dramatic spikes in hospital traffic around this period in October. This provides circumstantial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may have already been circulating at this time. “Something was happening in October,” said Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital and director of the medical center’s Computational Epidemiology Lab. “Clearly, there was some level of social disruption taking place well before what was previously identified as the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic.” https://abcnews.go.com/International/satellite-data-suggests-coronavirus-hit-china-earlier-researchers/story?id=71123270 The Harvard study that analysed this satellite data also looked at Baidu search terms in the area, and found an increase in queries relating to “cough” (potentially could also be due to seasonal influenza) as well as “diarrhea”, a COVID-19-specific symptom, providing further supporting evidence. https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/42669767/Satellite_Images_Baidu_COVID19_manuscript_DASH.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y PDF Archive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxZFnGwZwzDC_t93tvAuzSvfbmbQctwX/view?usp=sharing

- From Science Magazine: “Last year, a U.S. government review panel quietly approved experiments proposed by two labs that were previously considered so dangerous that federal officials had imposed an unusual top-down moratorium on such research. One of the projects has already received funding from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and will start in a few weeks; the other is awaiting funding. “After a deliberative process that cost $1 million for [a consultant’s] external study and consumed countless weeks and months of time for many scientists, we are now being asked to trust a completely opaque process where the outcome is to permit the continuation of dangerous experiments,” says Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch.” https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/exclusive-controversial-experiments-make-bird-flu-more-risky-poised-resume

13 November 2017
- Dr Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr Shi Zhengli from Wuhan, publish another paper describing gain-of-function research done in coronaviruses in bats in a BSL-2 lab in Wuhan (see also: 26 June 2016). “The Wuhan Institute of Virology had continued to unearth dozens of new SARS-like coronaviruses in bat caves, and it reported making chimeras with eight of them by fusing the spikes of the new viruses to the chassis of WIV1. Two of them replicated well in human cells. They were, for all intents and purposes, brand-new pathogens.” In an email to MIT Technology Review, Shi said she followed Chinese rules that are similar to US. Since bat viruses like WIV1 haven’t been confirmed to cause disease in human beings, her biosafety committee recommended BSL-2 for engineering and testing them but BSL-3 for any animal experiments. Regarding the decision to do the research in BSL-2 conditions, Peter Daszak forwarded a statement from EcoHealth Alliance stating that the organization “must follow the local laws of the countries in which we work’ and that the NIH had determined the research was ‘not gain-of-function.’”https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/29/1027290/gain-of-function-risky-bat-virus-engineering-links-america-to-wuhan/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5708621/ 

23 October 2017
- John Hopkins Center for Health Security releases a fictional pandemic scenario called SPARS, modelled off a SARS-like virus. The scenario is aimed to teach policymakers appropriate pandemic responses. The fictional pandemic does not end up killing as many people as originally forecasted. Moreover, the vaccines, which are rushed to market, have severe side effects. The pandemic ends with the President apologizing to the brave and patriotic Americans that took these experimental and harmful vaccines during a time of national crisis.

- World Bank Launches First-Ever Pandemic Bonds to Support $500 Million Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility: “In an effort to fight the next pandemic faster, the World Bank has turned to global financial markets, issuing $425 million in “pandemic bonds” and related derivatives to pay for emergency relief. The World Bank’s bond sale was 200% oversubscribed, with investors eager to get their hands on the high-yield returns on offer. The majority of buyers were from Europe and included dedicated catastrophe-bond investors, pension funds, and asset managers.” Note that investors lose their money if a pandemic is declared in 2020 (very conveniently happens).

27 February 2017
- Wuhan Institute of Virology, situated in Wuhan, becomes the first BSL-4 lab in mainland China. “BSL-4 is the highest level of biocontainment: its criteria include filtering air and treating water and waste before they leave the laboratory, and stipulating that researchers change clothes and shower before and after using lab facilities. Such labs are often controversial.” Concerns are already being raised at the lab’s opening: “But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping BSL-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy.” https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.21487

12 February 2016
- A statement by Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance, was reported in the National Academies of Press Publication that highlights his interest in using the media to stir up interest in a pan-coronavirus vaccine that would work for all coronaviruses: "We need to increase public understanding of the need for medical countermeasures such as a pan-coronavirus vaccine. A key driver is the media, and the economics will follow the hype. We need to use that hype to our advantage to get to the real issues. Investors will respond if they see profit at the end of the process."

The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis.” This research occurred during the gain-of-function ban by Congress, but apparently was allowed to go ahead since it began before the ban came into effect. https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985 Commentary: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/25/opinion/coronavirus-lab.html

- US announces moratorium on gain-of-function research. This means that experiments involving gain-of-function in viruses will no longer be funded. 
In the past, “NIH has funded such studies because they help define the fundamental nature of human-pathogen interactions, enable the assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents, and inform public health and preparedness efforts,” National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said in a statement. “These studies, however, also entail biosafety and biosecurity risks, which need to be understood better.” https://www.the-scientist.com/the-nutshell/moratorium-on-gain-of-function-research-36564
